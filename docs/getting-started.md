Welcome to the SnapTrade developer hub test 2. You'll find comprehensive documentation for all our endpoints, as well as detailed guides that will be added shortly.

If you need help or have any questions, send us an email at api@snaptrade.com.

If you already have API Keys, try using [our demo
tool](demo:) to make
different types of requests.

---

## API Status

Call the :api[ApiStatus_check] endpoint to make sure the API is live and that you can make the most basic request. You should receive a response indicating the API status, current server timestamp, and internal API minor version number.

Example:

```json
{ "version": 151, "timestamp": "2022-01-24T19:02:46.440074Z", "online": true }
```

## Register a test user

To create a secure brokerage authorization, we first need to register a test user.

Call the :api[Authentication_registerSnapTradeUser] endpoint with a `userId` which can be any string as long as it's unique to a user. Upon receiving a 200 response, the user is registered successfully and you should receive a response with a user id and a randomly generated user secret. You can think of the user secret like a per-user API key that provides an additional layer of security for protecting user data. The user id and user secret need to be passed along to all SnapTrade API endpoints that involve access to user data.

Example:

```json
{ "userId": "USERID123", "userSecret": "AYSEY8726837292873" }
```

:::note
If trading is enabled for a partner, users also need to provide a PIN (or create one if a first-time user)
before logging into the SnapTrade portal.
:::

---

## Generate a login link

SnapTrade partners need to generate a redirect URI for a user so they can securely log in to the SnapTrade Connection portal and connect their accounts.

The redirect URI can be generated by sending a `POST` request to the
:api[Authentication_loginSnapTradeUser] endpoint. `userId` and
`userSecret` (previously generated through calling the `registerUser` endpoint)
have to be in the query parameters of the POST request.

The response would indicate a `redirectURI` to be used for login a user to the SnapTrade portal.

Example:

```json
{
  "redirectURI": "https://app.snaptrade.com/snapTrade/redeemToken?token=TOKEN&clientId=PASSIVTEST"
}
```

:::note
If trading is enabled for a partner, users also need to provide a PIN (or create one if a first-time user)
before logging into the SnapTrade portal.
:::

---

## Connect an account through the Connection Portal

Once a user successfully logs into the SnapTrade portal, they can select their brokerage and go through the OAuth flow to connect their brokerage accounts.

:::note
For the initial connection, partners can pass in a broker name in the URI so users can go directly to the selected brokerage and make a connection.

Example: https://app.snaptrade.com/snapTrade/redeemToken?token=TOKEN&clientId=PASSIVTEST&broker=Questrade
:::

## Pull user holdings

In order to retrieve user holdings for a specific account, you can call the :api[AccountInformation_getAllUserHoldings] endpoint by passing the `clientId`, `timestamp`, `userId` and list of account numbers (`accounts`) to filter the holdings.

In the response, you should get an array of objects containing each account holdings data.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "account": {
      "id": "908192",
      "brokerage": "X",
      "number": "123456",
      "name": "Y"
    },
    "balances": [
      {
        "currency": {
          "id": "123",
          "code": "CA",
          "name": "Canadian dollar"
        },
        "cash": 1200
      }
    ],
    "positions": [
      {
        "symbol": {
          "symbol": "SYMBL",
          "name": "Symbol name",
          "currency": {
            "id": "123",
            "code": "CA",
            "name": "Canadian dollar"
          },
          "exchange": {
            "code": "123123",
            "name": "X"
          }
        },
        "units": "1",
        "price": 12
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Place a non-marketable order

To place an order through SnapTrade API, you need to go through the following two steps:

1- To receive information on how a specific order will impact an account, send a
`POST` request to :api[Trading_getOrderImpact] endpoint. The
following example is how the body of the request should look like:

```json
{
  "account_id": "123456",
  "universal_symbol_id": "78910",
  "order_type": "Limit",
  "time_in_force": "Day",
  "action": "BUY",
  "units": 1,
  "price": 12.9
}
```

Example of the response:

```json
{
  "trade": {
    "id": "0987654321",
    "account": "ACCOUNTID",
    "order_type": "Limit",
    "time_in_force": "Day",
    "symbol": {
      "brokerage_symbol_id": "1234567",
      "universal_symbol_id": "8912345",
      "currency": {
        "id": "012345",
        "code": "USD"
      },
      "local_id": "121314",
      "description": "SYMBOL",
      "symbol": "SYMBL"
    },
    "action": "BUY",
    "units": 1,
    "price": 12.9
  },
  "trade_impacts": [
    {
      "account": "778899",
      "currency": "023901",
      "remaining_cash": -466.0569,
      "estimated_commissions": 0.0,
      "forex_fees": 0.0
    },
    {
      "account": "12132214",
      "currency": "f123123",
      "remaining_cash": 667.8219,
      "estimated_commissions": 0.0,
      "forex_fees": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "combined_remaining_balance": {
    "account": "99881882",
    "currency": "57fs1223",
    "cash": 64.5564
  }
}
```

:::warn
An order impact request can fail with a 400 response code due to reasons such as `Markets are not open`, `Not enough cash to place trades`, `Exchange does not support market orders`, etc. The reason for a failed request would be in the body of the response.
:::

Example of the response for a failed request:

```json
{
  "detail": "Not enough cash to place trades",
  "status_code": 400,
  "code": "1068"
}
```

---

2- To place the order you need to send in the trade id (received through calling
the `Trade Impact` endpoint) as a query parameter to the :api[Trading_placeOrder] endpoint.
The successful request would indicate the status of the order (`EXECUTED`,
`ACCEPTED`, `FAILED`, `REJECTED`, `PENDING`, etc.) along with other information related
to the order placed.

Example of the response:

```json
{
  "brokerage_order_id": "123456",
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "symbol": "7891011",
  "universal_symbol": {
    "id": "123456",
    "symbol": "SYMBL",
    "description": "Symbol",
    "currency": {
      "id": "1021993",
      "code": "USD",
      "name": "US Dollar"
    },
    "currencies": [],
    "type": {
      "id": "ceb92399",
      "code": "code",
      "is_supported": true
    }
  },
  "action": "BUY",
  "total_quantity": "1.00000000",
  "open_quantity": "1.00000000",
  "canceled_quantity": "0.00000000",
  "filled_quantity": "0.00000000",
  "execution_price": "0.0000",
  "limit_price": "12.9000",
  "stop_price": null,
  "order_type": "Limit",
  "time_in_force": "Day",
  "time_placed": "2022-01-01T10:08:09.044000-05:00",
  "time_updated": "2022-01-01T10:08:09.113000-05:00",
  "expiry_date": null
}
```

## Delete a non-marketable order

To cancel an open order, you need to `POST` to the
:api[Trading_cancelUserAccountOrder] endpoint with the `account id` in the query
params and the `brokerage order id` in the body of the request.
